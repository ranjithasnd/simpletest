UNIT TESTING:

1.Unit testing, a testing technique using which individual modules are tested. 
2.The main aim is to isolate each unit of the system to identify, analyze and fix the defects.
3.Unit Testing - Advantages: 
		* It reduces Defects in the Newly developed features or reduces bugs when changing the existing functionality.
		* Reduces Cost of Testing as defects are captured in very early phase. 
		* It will improves design and allows better refactoring of code. 
		* Unit Tests, when integrated with build gives the quality of the build as well.


Unit Tesing life cycle: 
							1.check in code into the repository
							2.check out code from the repository
							3.make changes
							4.Execute Unit tests
							5.Fix defects and re-execute unit tests
							6.code review
				
The following steps are keeps on reapeting.		

Unit testing Techniques:	
			
				Block Box Testing - Using which the user interfaces inputs and outputs are tested.
				White Box Testing - Used to test each one of those functions and behaviour is tested.
				Gray Box Teting - Used to execute tests risks and assessment methods.
